QCM means Questionnaires Ã  Choix Multiple (English translation: Multiple Choice Questions). 

This project is about creating an application for parents to make their children work based on questions/answers. What I want to do is exercices that can be modified easily by the parents (json files ?). 

Next steps will be to add a database, and parents will be able to add and modify new questions.
